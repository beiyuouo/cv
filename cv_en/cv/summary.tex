I am a second-year master's student majoring in Electronic Information.
My previous work primarily focuses on \textbf{efficient and heterogeneous federated learning algorithms and systems}, particularly in \textbf{healthcare applications},
and aims to build a robust, efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving AI system for real-world applications.
I have a strong interest in \textbf{Edge AI for healthcare}, \textbf{federated learning}, and \textbf{medical data analysis}.
I am eagerly looking for a Ph.D. position in \textbf{Fall 2025}.
% I am a second-year master's student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My research interest mainly focused on \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{federated learning}}} and \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{AI for healthcare}}},
% particularly in the areas of \textit{\textbf{multi-modal medical data}} and aim to develop robust, efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserved AI solutions for real-world applications.
% My previous work has primarily focused on \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{Trustworthy FL}}}, specifically in \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{asynchronous federated learning}}} and \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{privacy-preserving}}} in medical field.

% In the future, I aim to further explore the intersection of AI and healthcare, delving into the development of more robust, privacy-preserving and scalable AI solutions for real-world applications.
