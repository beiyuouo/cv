I am a second-year master's student majoring in Electronic Information.
My previous work primarily focuses on \textit{\textbf{efficient and heterogeneous federated learning algorithms and systems}}, particularly in \textit{\textbf{healthcare applications}},
and aim to build a robust, efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving \textit{\textbf{AI system}} for \textit{\textbf{real-world applications}}.
Furthermore, I have a strong interest in \textit{\textbf{Edge AI for healthcare}}, \textit{\textbf{medical data analysis}}, and \textit{\textbf{multi-modal federated learning}}.
I am eagerly looking for a Ph.D. position in \textit{\textbf{Fall 2025}}.
% I am a second-year master's student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My research interest mainly focused on \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{federated learning}}} and \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{AI for healthcare}}},
% particularly in the areas of \textit{\textbf{multi-modal medical data}} and aim to develop robust, efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserved AI solutions for real-world applications.
% My previous work has primarily focused on \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{Trustworthy FL}}}, specifically in \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{asynchronous federated learning}}} and \textcolor{awesome-darknight}{\textit{\textbf{privacy-preserving}}} in medical field.

% In the future, I aim to further explore the intersection of AI and healthcare, delving into the development of more robust, privacy-preserving and scalable AI solutions for real-world applications.
