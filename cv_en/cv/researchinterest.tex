I am a second-year master's student majoring in Artificial Intelligence, 
with a strong focus on \textit{\textbf{federated learning}} and its applications in healthcare, 
particularly \textit{\textbf{multi-modal medical data analysis}}. 
My research aims to develop robust, efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving AI solutions for real-world healthcare applications. 
My previous work has primarily focused on \textit{\textbf{asynchronous federated learning}} and \textit{\textbf{privacy-preserving}} methods in the medical field. 
I am looking for a Ph.D position in 2025 fall.
